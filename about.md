This is my personal blog, where I will mostly explore and discuss topics related to biological data science.  

## About the author

As a scientist, most of the time I feel split between two worlds of converging evolutions.  
  
Drawn to molecular biology by my early fascination for diversity and complexity, I studied Biology at the Faculty of Sciences in Lisbon, Portugal.
This exposed me mostly to the fields of Molecular Biology and Genetics (because of my minor in these areas), but gave me an additional broader perspective
on the living world. Diversity happens at all scales, and this drives the intricate relationships between biological players, from proteins and nucleic 
acids, to penguin and fish (I like penguins).  
  
Searching for ways to made large and quantitative molecular descriptions of cells, I did a Masters in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, focusing on 
various -omics datasets. In particular, for my thesis, I used mNET-seq data to study different RNA polymerase II modification profiles, with a special focus
on co-transcriptional splicing. This allowed me to dissect the works of transcription and RNA biogenesis, obtaining a detailed overview of how many types of
transcripts are generated.

Currently, drawn by an interest in large biological datasets and the unrivalled complexity of the immune system (save maybe for the nervous system...), I joined
the Teichmann lab at the Wellcome Sanger Institute as a PhD student funded by the ENLIGHT-TEN Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie action (from Horizon 2020). My research 
focus is on the comparative analysis of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from different tissues, and how these environments can influence their identity.


## About this website

This website was created using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/). See more on the first blogpost, which is the Jekyll test post.

The website's theme borrowed from [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), [vitae](https://github.com/myJekyll/vitae) and [Block-Log](https://github.com/anandubajith/block-log).

Publishing had help from [this guide](https://shiring.github.io/blogging/2016/12/04/diy_your_own_blog).
