Brexit. No one really knows what’s happening. No one really knows where
things are going.  
And I am not going to try to explain much. But I recently found out that
the voting record of Members of Parliament (MPs) [can be easily obtained
for each vote](https://commonsvotes.digiminster.com/), so I decided to
collect their decisions of some recent Brexit-related votes, guided by
[this list from The
Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/mar/29/brexit-debate-latest-developments-live-news-may-at-risk-of-fresh-defeat-as-mps-debate-withdrawal-agreement-for-third-time-live-news?page=with:block-5c9ddbe1e4b0b4d18bde246e#block-5c9ddbe1e4b0b4d18bde246e),
to get a good picture of who’s voting together and maybe pinpoint which
MPs might swing one way or the other. The data used see at what point it
is saved) will be stored [here](votes_files/full_votes.tsv).

Lets start by loading a few useful libraries

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(generalizedPCA) # from https://github.com/andland/generalizedPCA/blob/master/README.md
library(pheatmap)

party_cols = c("Conservative" = "blue", "Labour" = "red", "Scottish National Party" = "#dce000",
               "Liberal Democrat" = "#d6b500", "Green Party" = "#84e579", "Plaid Cymru" = "#13b201",
               "Independent" = "grey50", "Democratic Unionist Party" = "#f713a0")
```

And read in the data

``` r
f = list.files("data/", pattern = "csv")
vote_tabs = lapply(paste0("data/", f), read.csv, skip = 9, header = T)
names(vote_tabs) = gsub(".csv", "", f, fixed = T)
```

Now we clean the data. It comes in a very uniform format, so it is quite
easy to put together

``` r
merge_f = function(x, y){
  return(merge(x, y, by = 1))
}
all_votes = Reduce(merge_f, vote_tabs)
all_votes = all_votes[,c(1,2,3,grep("Vote", colnames(all_votes)))]
colnames(all_votes) = c("Member", "Party", "Constituency", names(vote_tabs))
all_votes = apply(all_votes, 2, function(x) gsub("Teller - Ayes", "Aye", x))
all_votes = data.frame(apply(all_votes, 2, function(x) gsub("Teller - Noes", "No", x)))
all_votes[,4:ncol(all_votes)] = lapply(all_votes[,4:ncol(all_votes)], 
                                       function(x) factor(x, levels = c("Aye", "No", "No Vote Recorded")))

write.table(all_votes, "data/full_votes.tsv", col.names = T, quote = F, sep = "\t")

# removing Speaker(s) and Sinn Fein party to facilitate with the colours (they always abstain)
all_votes = all_votes[!grepl("Speaker", all_votes$Party) & !grepl("Sinn", all_votes$Party),]

# one MP/Constituency is duplicated for some reason, so I'm just keeping the first entry
## difference is in June 30th extension (has one Aye and one No)
all_votes = all_votes[!duplicated(all_votes[,1]),]
```

I’m also taking this chance to try out a different type of PCA. Because
the data is discrete, a standard PCA might not be the best way to
represent the data. If we consider abstension NA, each vote can be
consiered binomially distributed, so we can rely on the
[generalizedPCA](https://github.com/andland/generalizedPCA/blob/master/README.md)
package to use an algorithm that accounts for this. In parallel, I also
formated the data into Aye = 1, No = -1, and Abstention = 0, which have
a more approximate Normal distribution and so can be tried on the
gaussian version.

``` r
# prepare for binomial PCA
all_votes_mu = all_votes[,-c(1,2,3)]
all_votes_mu[all_votes_mu=="No Vote Recorded"] = NA
all_votes_mu = data.frame(lapply(all_votes_mu, as.integer))
all_votes_mu[all_votes_mu=="1"] = 1
all_votes_mu[all_votes_mu=="2"] = 0
rownames(all_votes_mu) = all_votes$Member

# prepare for gaussian PCA
all_votes_re = reshape2::melt(all_votes, id.vars = c("Member", "Party", "Constituency"))

all_votes_re$n_value = ifelse(all_votes_re$value=="No", -1,
                              ifelse(all_votes_re$value=="Aye", 1, 0))

all_votes_mat = reshape2::dcast(all_votes_re, variable ~ Member, value.var = "n_value")
rownames(all_votes_mat) = all_votes_mat[,1]
all_votes_mat = t(all_votes_mat[,-1])
```

For the binomial PCA, the [logisticPCA
vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/logisticPCA/vignettes/logisticPCA.html)
explains that we should optimise parameter `m`, which is used to
approximate the natural parameters from the saturated model.

``` r
# choosing the m parameter by cross validation
cvm = cv.gpca(as.matrix(all_votes_mu), ks = seq(6, 18, 3), Ms = 1:30, family = "binomial")
```

    ## Warning in generalizedPCA(x[c != cv, ], k = k, M = M, family = family, weights = weights[c != : Deviance increased in last iteration.
    ## This should not happen!

``` r
plot(cvm)
```

<img src="votes_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We also chose k = 15, since we don’t need more. Now for the gaussian
PCA, and then a comparison of their coordinates.

``` r
pca_binomial = generalizedPCA(all_votes_mu, k = 15, M = 9, family = "binomial")
pca_gaussian = generalizedPCA(all_votes_mat, k = 15, family = "gaussian") # equivalent result to prcomp

colnames(pca_binomial$PCs) = colnames(pca_gaussian$PCs) = paste0("PC", 1:15)
rownames(pca_gaussian$U) = colnames(all_votes_mat)
rownames(pca_binomial$U) = colnames(all_votes_mu)

# absolute correlation will tell us if PCs are similar without caring whether they're flipped
pheatmap(abs(cor(pca_binomial$PCs, pca_gaussian$PCs)), cluster_rows = F, cluster_cols = F)
```

<img src="votes_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can see that in the initial PCs things will look very (but not
completely) similar. These are also by far the most important PCs in
terms of variance explained (PC1 accounts for ~60%).  
We can now look at how parties are organised in PC space, and illustrate
some viewpoints by adding some key players of the Brexit debate. Because
many MPs have a similar voting pattern, we add some jitter to the plots.

``` r
pc_plot = function(dat, pc1 = "PC1", pc2 = "PC2", col, tit){
  ## key politicians
  lab_df1 = dat[dat$Member %in% c("Jacob Rees-Mogg", "Theresa May", "Jeremy Corbyn",
                                   "Nigel Dodds", "Vince Cable", "Ian Blackford", "David Davis",
                                   "Caroline Spelman", "David T. C. Davies", "Mark Hendrick",
                                   "Kate Hoey", "Kenneth Clarke", "Graham Brady", "Oliver Letwin"),]
  
  plt = ggplot(dat, aes_string(x = pc1, y = pc2, colour = col))+
    geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1, size = 1.75, alpha = 0.8)+
    ggrepel::geom_label_repel(data = lab_df1, mapping = aes(label = Member),
                              size = 3.9, box.padding = unit(0.05, "cm"), 
                              min.segment.length = unit(0, "cm"),
                              label.padding = unit(0.1, "cm"), show.legend = F)+
    scale_colour_manual(values = party_cols)+
    ggtitle(tit)+
    guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 2)))+
    theme_bw()+
    theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
  
  return(plt)
}

# binomial PCA
plot_df1 = merge(all_votes, pca_binomial$PCs, by.x = 1, by.y = 0)
pcab_names = pc_plot(plot_df1, col = "Party", tit = "binomial PCA")

# gaussian PCA
plot_df2 = merge(all_votes, pca_gaussian$PCs, by.x = 1, by.y = 0)
pcag_names = pc_plot(plot_df2, col = "Party", tit = "gaussian PCA")

# plot
cowplot::plot_grid(pcab_names+theme(legend.position = "none"), pcag_names,align = "h", ncol = 2,
                   rel_widths = c(1, 1.58))
```

As expected, both PCs have a similar structure, with PC1 marking the
eparation between government and oposition. We can also see the great
breadth of opinions for Tories, with the harder Brexiters on top and the
softer Brexiters and remainers in the bottom of PC2.  
We can see the voting patterns organised by PC of the decisions that
shape these components.

``` r
plot_votes = merge(all_votes, pca_binomial$PCs, by.x = 1, by.y = 0)

hist_vote = function(dat, pc, var){
  plt = ggplot(dat, aes_string(x = pc, fill = var))+
    geom_histogram()+
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("chartreuse3", "firebrick2", "grey50"))+
    ggtitle(var)+
    theme_bw()+
    theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
          legend.key.size = unit(0.4, "cm"),
          legend.title = element_blank())
  return(plt)
}

indvotes_pc1 = hist_vote(plot_votes, "PC1", "AllowIndicativeVotes_Amm")
tmv_pc1 = hist_vote(plot_votes, "PC1", "ThirdMeaningfulVote")
nodeal_pc2 = hist_vote(plot_votes, "PC2", "IV_No.deal")
fmv_pc2 = hist_vote(plot_votes, "PC2", "FirstMeaningfulVote")

plot_grid(indvotes_pc1, tmv_pc1,
          nodeal_pc2, fmv_pc2, nrow = 2, ncol = 2, align = "hv")
```

<img src="votes_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This shows that, while the first meaningful vote of Theresa May’s
agreement clearly split the Tories, for the third vote that recently
happened the division is more evident between government and opposition.

``` r
pcab_names34 = pc_plot(plot_df1, "PC2", "PC3", col = "Party", tit = "binomial PCA")
pcab_names45 = pc_plot(plot_df1, "PC3", "PC4", col = "Party", tit = "binomial PCA")

# plot
cowplot::plot_grid(pcab_names34+theme(legend.position = "none"), pcab_names45,
                   align = "h", ncol = 2, rel_widths = c(1, 1.58))
```

PC3 is harder to interpret, but it appears to show a the MPs more in
favour of a resolution per the governments terms in the rightmost
values. Indeed, as we’ll see below, those MPs have voted in favour of
all motions put forward by people aligned with the government, as well
as the meaningful votes.  
The fourth principal component is very interesting from the side of the
opposition, since it splits Labour from all other parties. This PC is
mostly driven by indicative votes, and shows that the MPs at the top
(mostly from SNP and Lib Dems) would rather revoke Article 50 or have a
second vote, whereas at the bottom most favourable votes went to a
Common Market or Customs Union solution.  
Below we can see some of the variables discussed.

``` r
bs_hist = hist_vote(plot_votes, "PC3", "NextStep_BradySpelman")
ext_hist = hist_vote(plot_votes, "PC3", "Extension30June")
rev_hist = hist_vote(plot_votes, "PC4", "IV_Revocation.to.avoid.no.deal")
cm_hist = hist_vote(plot_votes, "PC4", "IV_Common.market.2")

plot_grid(bs_hist, ext_hist, rev_hist, cm_hist,
          nrow = 2, ncol = 2, align = "hv")
```

Brexit is getting more and more confusing, but is hopefully coming to a
close. From this analysis on the voting of MPs, I get the impression
that there are some groups that clearly want to compromise, maybe those
in the middle of PC4. But honestly, who knows?…

I also liked writing this post because of this type of data. I’ve been
wanting to try this sort of alternative PCA’s for a while, and this was
an interesting dataset to do it. It has become more and more clear that
count data (which is related to the sort used here) requires the use of
distributions that better represent it (as was shown recently in my
field in [this
preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/574574v1) and [this
preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/576827v2)), as opposed to 
a transformation to a gaussian distribution. I’m looking forward to 
learning more about this and to see the whole Brexit mess come to a 
conclusion (hopefully as close as possible with the Union).
