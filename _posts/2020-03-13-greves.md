*NOTE: this post will be partially bilingual, due to the “portuguese”
nature of the data.*

While browsing Reddit last week, I came across [this
post](https://pt.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/fgao3s/grevistas_do_reddit_quando_%C3%A9_v%C3%A3o_fazer_greves_a/)
complaining that a lot of strikes in Portugal (particularlly those from
public servants) happen on Mondays or Fridays. Well, I wanted to see if
this was really the case.

From a quick search, I found [this
table](https://www.dgaep.gov.pt/index.cfm?&OBJID=32B5C008-D957-4C3E-B00A-2ECE2208212A&ComDest=0&Tab=4)
from the “direção-geral da administração e do emprego público”
(something like the department for public employment), which appears to
mention all the strike notices posted in advance by different unions.

So we’ll start by loading a few packages to help handle and plot the
data

``` r
library(htmltab) # read table from html
library(stringr) # handle strings
library(ggplot2) # make nice plots
library(lubridate) # work with dates
```

And now we have to get the data. Because it is displayed in an
interactive table, the best way to understand the format is to inspect
the page (by pressing F12). Weirdly enough, this data is saved as a full
HTML table. So we will use the ‘htmltab’ function from the ‘htmltab’
package, which very easily reads in tables from html pages.

``` r
url = "https://www.dgaep.gov.pt/index.cfm?&OBJID=32B5C008-D957-4C3E-B00A-2ECE2208212A&ComDest=0&Tab=4"
greves = htmltab(doc = url, which = 1)
colnames(greves) = c("entidade", "ano", "periodo", "ambito", "area")
dim(greves)
```

    ## [1] 1383    5

Now we need to do some cleaning. We’ll be wanting to remove cancelled
strikes, as well as those spanning more than 1 day. Then we’ll put all
dates in the same format, and finally we’ll clean up the general name of
the department that each strike concerns.

``` r
# remove strikes spanning multiple dates or cancelled strikes (they will have text and/or other punctuation)
greves_filt = greves[!grepl(",", greves$periodo, fixed = T) & 
                       !grepl("(", greves$periodo, fixed = T) &
                       !grepl(" ", greves$periodo, fixed = T) &
                       !grepl("[a-z]", greves$periodo),]

# fix some dates that are missing the year
greves_filt$periodo[str_count(greves_filt$periodo, "/")==1] = paste0(greves_filt$periodo[str_count(greves_filt$periodo,
                                                                                                   "/")==1],
                                                                     "/", greves_filt$ano[str_count(greves_filt$periodo,
                                                                                                    "/")==1])

# and put all dates in the same format
greves_filt$periodo = as.Date(gsub("/", "-", greves_filt$periodo, fixed = T), format = "%d-%m-%Y")

# fix area
greves_filt$area = gsub("Ã§", "c", greves_filt$area, fixed = F)
greves_filt$area = gsub("Ã£", "a", greves_filt$area, fixed = F)
greves_filt$area = gsub("Ãª", "e", greves_filt$area, fixed = F)
greves_filt$area = gsub("Ãº", "u", greves_filt$area, fixed = F)
greves_filt$area = gsub("Ã“", "O", greves_filt$area, fixed = F)

greves_filt$area[grepl("dmini", greves_filt$area)] ="Administracao"
greves_filt$area[grepl("Geral AP", greves_filt$area)] ="Administracao"
greves_filt$area[grepl("Educacao;", greves_filt$area, fixed = F)] ="Educacao"
greves_filt$area[grepl("Seguranca", greves_filt$area, fixed = F)] ="Seguranca Social"

dim(greves_filt)
```

    ## [1] 812   5

This leaves us with 812 strikes, from 2011 to 2020. We can now use the
‘wday’ function in the lubridate package to get the corresponding
weekday for each date. I prefer this to “weekdays” from the base
package, since it directly returns an ordered factor (with label =
TRUE).

``` r
greves_filt$weekday = wday(greves_filt$periodo, label=TRUE)

plot_df = data.frame(table(greves_filt$weekday))
plot_df$perc = plot_df$Freq/sum(plot_df$Freq)*100

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = Var1, y = perc))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  labs(x = "Day of the week", y = "%")+
  theme_bw()
```

<img src="greves_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

It seems the closer we are to the end of the week, the more likely it is
to have a strike. However, given the lower number on Mondays, this does
not necessarily mean that strikes will be closer to the weekend to the
weekend (either Saturday OR Sunday). The preference for Friday can thus
be due to a mix of being before the weekend (which could boost adhesion
of people wanting a long weekend), and other factors that somehow give a
preference for strikes to happen later in the week.

We can also check how this trend has changed over the years

``` r
plot_df = data.frame(table(greves_filt$weekday, greves_filt$ano))

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq, colour = Var2, group = Var2))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired")+
  labs(x = "Day of the week", y = "number", colour = "Area")+
  theme_bw()
```

<img src="greves_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The trend seems to be mostly present every year, apart from 2011 and
2012. It should be also noted that more recent years seem to have a
higher number of registered strikes, which can be due to an actual
increase in protests, or to improved recording in recent years.

Lastly, let’s see how this breaks down by department

``` r
plot_df = data.frame(table(greves_filt$weekday, greves_filt$area))

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq, colour = Var2, group = Var2))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired")+
  labs(x = "Day of the week", y = "number", colour = "Area")+
  theme_bw()
```

<img src="greves_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

For the departments with the highest number of strikes (Education,
Public Administration, and Health) the trend seems to hold.
Interestingly, for general strikes (“Todas”), it appears that there is a
bias towards Thursdays.

Finally, some drawbacks of this analysis include: - information about
holidays - “duplicated” strikes (some General strikes also have
non-general strikes on the same day) - misannotation (some General
strikes might not be annotated as such) - all strikes in this database
are from civil servants - I’m not sure if the database is exhaustive
